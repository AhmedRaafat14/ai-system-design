# 10. Fine-Tuning and Model Adaptation

*Part II. Core Techniques · [Reading list](../README.md)*

### When it helps

- Consistent format, style, tone, or domain phrasing that prompting cannot
  hold reliably.
- Narrow structured tasks (classification, extraction, routing) where a
  tuned small model matches a frontier model at a fraction of the cost and
  latency.
- Teaching interaction patterns: your tool-calling conventions, your
  schema, your refusal policy.
- Distillation: generate high-quality traces with a strong teacher model,
  train a small student for the narrow route (check the teacher's terms of
  use first).

### When it does not

- Fresh or frequently changing facts: that is retrieval's job, and a tuned
  model with stale knowledge fails confidently.
- A moving product: every prompt or policy change may mean a retrain.
- As the first resort: exhaust prompting + retrieval and keep the [eval](../part-4-production-engineering/21-evaluation-strategy.md)
  gap as your justification.

### Methods, roughly in order of cost

- **SFT with LoRA/QLoRA**: parameter-efficient adapters (train ~1% of
  weights, 4-bit base for QLoRA); the default for most teams. Full-parameter
  SFT only when adapters demonstrably cap quality.
- **Preference tuning (DPO and successors)**: aligns behavior to
  chosen-vs-rejected pairs without a full RLHF pipeline; use for tone,
  safety posture, and judgment calls that are easier to rank than to write.
- **Continued pretraining**: for genuine language/domain gaps (e.g., an
  underrepresented dialect). Needs orders of magnitude more data and
  compute, and risks degrading general ability; a last resort.

### Process discipline

- Data quality beats volume: a few thousand excellent, deduplicated,
  decontaminated examples routinely beat tens of thousands of scraped ones.
  Keep a held-out test set that never touches training.
- Always eval before/after on both the target task AND general + safety
  suites; catastrophic forgetting and safety regressions are real and
  silent.
- Version datasets like code (hashes, lineage, changelogs). You will need
  to answer "what was this model trained on" later, possibly to a
  regulator.
- Even after tuning, keep facts in retrieval and business rules in code.
