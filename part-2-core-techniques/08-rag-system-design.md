# 8. RAG System Design

*Part II. Core Techniques · [Reading list](../README.md)*

### Ingestion pipeline

```text
Source systems
    ↓ Parse and normalize (document processing quality decides everything, see §29)
    ↓ Extract metadata and ACLs
    ↓ Structure-aware chunking (per document type)
    ↓ Contextual augmentation (prepend chunk-situating context)
    ↓ Embed + build BM25 index
    ↓ Version documents, chunks, and indexes; track lineage
    ↓ Evaluate retrieval quality on your own data
```

Store metadata with every chunk:

```json
{
  "chunk_id": "policy-2026-012#section-4",
  "document_id": "policy-2026-012",
  "title": "Refund Policy",
  "source_url": "https://internal.example/policy",
  "updated_at": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  "tenant_id": "tenant_123",
  "allowed_roles": ["support", "manager"],
  "embedding_model": "model-version",
  "content_hash": "sha256..."
}
```

### Contextual Retrieval (measured, not folklore)

The practitioner consensus (hybrid retrieval + reranking) is confirmed by
Anthropic's published benchmarks. Baseline top-20 retrieval failure rate of
5.7% improved as follows:

| Technique | Failure rate | Reduction |
|---|---|---|
| Contextual [embeddings](09-embeddings-and-vectors.md) (prepend ~50-100 token chunk context) | 3.7% | 35% |
| + Contextual BM25 (hybrid lexical + dense) | 2.9% | 49% |
| + Reranking (retrieve ~150, rerank, keep top ~20) | 1.9% | 67% |

Practical notes:

- Generate the chunk context with a cheap model + prompt caching; treat it
  as a one-time indexing cost.
- Reranking adds latency and cost; tune the candidate count for your SLO.
- These numbers came from codebases, papers, and fiction. Measure on your
  own corpus before trusting any published gains.

### Know when NOT to use RAG

If the whole knowledge base fits in roughly 200K tokens (about 500 pages),
put it in the prompt and use prompt caching instead of building a retrieval
pipeline. For code-like corpora, agentic just-in-time search (grep/glob
style tools) often beats embedding pipelines. Static RAG is also the wrong
tool for open-ended research tasks that need iterative exploration; that is
what agentic retrieval loops are for.

### Retrieval pipeline requirements

```text
Query → AuthZ/tenant filter → query classification and rewriting
      → dense + lexical retrieval → merge (e.g., RRF) → rerank
      → relevance/confidence gate → bounded context build
      → cited answer or abstain
```

- Filter by tenant, role, and document ACL **before** anything reaches the
  model. Vector stores with weak access control are their own [OWASP](../part-4-production-engineering/20-security.md)
  category now (LLM08: vector and embedding weaknesses, including index
  poisoning and cross-tenant leakage).
- Chunk per document type; preserve headings, tables, source URLs,
  timestamps, ownership.
- Query understanding earns its cost: classify (does this need retrieval at
  all?), rewrite conversational queries into standalone ones, decompose
  multi-part questions.
- Re-embed only changed sections; version embeddings, chunking logic, and
  indexes; keep rollback plans for index migrations.
- Require citations for knowledge-backed answers; abstain when relevance is
  low or sources conflict.
- Evaluate retrieval separately from generation: recall@k, MRR/nDCG for
  retrieval; faithfulness/groundedness and answer relevance for generation
  (RAGAS-style metrics plus human review). A high cosine score is not
  evidence of correctness.
- Consider GraphRAG for multi-hop questions over entity-heavy corpora, and
  agentic RAG for iterative retrieval. Adopt only after the boring hybrid
  pipeline is measured and found insufficient.
