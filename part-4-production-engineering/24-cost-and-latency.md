# 24. Cost and Latency Engineering

*Part IV. Production Engineering · [Reading list](../README.md)*

- **Prompt caching first.** Structure prompts as stable prefix (system,
  tools, reference docs) + variable suffix. Providers discount cached
  tokens heavily: Anthropic documents up to 90% cost and up to 85% latency
  reduction on long cached prompts (cache reads about 10% of input price);
  OpenAI also applies a substantial automatic cached-input discount. This is
  often the single largest lever in [RAG](../part-2-core-techniques/08-rag-system-design.md) and agent systems.
- **Model routing / cascades**: default to a small model, escalate to a
  large one on low confidence or hard routes; use batch APIs (typically
  about 50% cheaper) for offline work.
- **Context discipline is cost discipline**: compaction, tool result
  clearing, and token-efficient tool responses directly cut spend.
- Stream tokens for perceived latency; parallelize independent tool calls;
  cap max output tokens per route.
- **Semantic caching**: fine for public FAQs; dangerous for personalized or
  authorized content. Include auth scope and tenant in the cache key or
  skip it.
- Track spend per route, per tenant, per feature, and alert on anomalies
  (see [Unbounded Consumption](20-security.md)).
