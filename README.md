# AI System Design Reference

A practitioner reference for engineers, tech leads, and teams who build AI
systems: from choosing an approach, through core techniques (prompting, RAG,
fine-tuning, agents), to production engineering, data operations, specialized
systems, and governance.

This is the index. The material is an ordered reading list: each Part builds on
the ones before it, and every section is its own file so you can read straight
through or jump to what you need. Sections link to each other where topics
connect.

> Principle: treat AI systems as probabilistic distributed systems, not as
> ordinary API integrations. Design for containment and recovery, not for a
> model that never fails.

## Start here

- **[Foundations](00-foundations.md)**: framing and the six first principles the
  rest of the reference is built on. Read this first.
- Prefer the whole thing on one page? **[full-reference.md](full-reference.md)** is
  the complete original, unsplit.

*Sources and further reading live in [Appendix F](appendices/f-sources.md). The
appendices (failure handling, readiness checklist, anti-patterns, metrics,
definition of done) are working documents for design reviews and launches, not
part of the linear path.*
